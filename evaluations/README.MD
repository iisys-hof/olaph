The evaluations files for mismatches contain columns in the following order:

- OLaPh phonemization
- Gruut phonemization
- eSpeak phonemization
- Which phonemizer made a mistake (1 = olaph, 2 = gruut, 3 = espeak, - = negligible difference, ? = multiple ways of phonemization or unclear)
- grapheme


The hard corpus file contains 100 examples of sentences, which are considered very hard to phonemize as they contain cross-lingual expressions, names and homographs.
